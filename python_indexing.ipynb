    "\n",
    "NumPy indexing serves two purposes:\n",
    "1. **Reading data**: Extract values to examine or use in calculations\n",
    "2. **Writing data**: Modify values directly in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore both sides systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading Data with Indexing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Single elements\n",
    "print(\"First element:\", arr1d[0])          # → 1\n",
    "print(\"Element at (1,2):\", arr2d[1, 2])   # → 6\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slices (ranges of elements)\n",
    "print(\"First three:\", arr1d[1:4])         # → [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "print(\"First row:\", arr2d[0, :])          # → [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(\"Second column:\", arr2d[:, 1])      # → [2, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing Data with Indexing\n",
    "Now here's the powerful part: the same indexing syntax works for assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Modify single elements\n",
    "arr1d[0] = 99\n",
    "print(\"Modified:\", arr1d)                 # → [99, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify ranges\n",
    "arr1d[1:4] = 8\n",
    "print(\"After slice assignment:\", arr1d)   # → [99, 8, 8, 8, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify 2D selections\n",
    "arr2d[0, :] = 42                         # Set entire first row to 42\n",
    "print(\"Modified 2D:\\n\", arr2d)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern: Whatever you can read with indexing, you can also write to with assignment.\n",
    "Why This Matters\n",
    "This dual nature makes NumPy incredibly powerful for data manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning: `arr[arr < 0] = 0` (set negative values to zero)\n",
    "Feature engineering: `arr[:, 0] *= 2` (double the first column)\n",
    "Conditional updates: `arr[arr > threshold] = threshold` (cap extreme values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding that indexing is both a \"getter\" and a \"setter\" opens up many data processing possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Indexing for Extraction vs Modification\n",
    "\n",

    "**Key rules:**\n",
    "- Negative indices are converted to `len(axis) + index` internally.\n",
    "- When using a negative step, make sure the `start` index is greater than the `end` index, otherwise the result is empty.\n",

    "- The `:` operator syntax: `start:end:step`\n",
    "- How empty positions use defaults: `[:3]` = \"from start to 3\", `[2:]` = \"from 2 to end\"\n",
    "- Negative indices count from the end: `[-1]` = last element, `[-2:]` = last two elements\n",
    "- Negative steps reverse direction: `[::-1]` reverses the entire array\n",
    "- How slicing works across multiple dimensions: `arr[1:3, 0:2]`\n",

Since we're asking for tensor[0,1] four times, and tensor[0,1] contains all values along dimensions 3 and 4 (a 2D matrix), we get 4 copies of that same 2D matrix.\n",

    "- Fancy indexing uses lists/arrays of indices instead of single numbers\n",
    "- `arr[[0, 2, 4]]` selects elements at positions 0, 2, and 4\n",
    "- For 2D+ arrays, you need one index list per dimension you want to specify\n",
    "- **Critical insight**: `arr[[0,0,0]]` means \"give me index 0 three times\" not \"go to position (0,0,0)\"\n",
    "- Fancy indexing creates copies, while slicing creates views\n",
    "- You can assign through fancy indexing: `arr[[1,3]] = 0`\n",

    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important: Fancy Indexing vs Slicing (Copy vs View)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the **biggest differences** between slicing and fancy indexing is how NumPy treats memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slicing** → returns a **view** (a window) on the original array.  \n",
    "  If you modify the slice, you modify the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fancy indexing** → returns a **copy** of the data.  \n",
    "  If you modify the result of fancy indexing, the original array stays unchanged.  \n",
    "  However, if you use fancy indexing **on the left side of an assignment**, NumPy updates the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
